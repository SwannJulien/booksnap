// Prefix put in front of every API path.

// Empty by default, and that is the interesting part: calls then go to the origin
// serving the page. In development that is the Vite dev server, which proxies /api to
// :8080 (see vite.config.js). Everything stays same-origin, which removes CORS, removes
// the SameSite question, and removes the failure where Vite silently picks another port
// because 3000 was taken and the declared origin no longer matches.
//
// VITE_API_BASE_URL overrides it for a deployment where the API sits on another host.
// Doing so puts the API on a different origin than the page: the origin then has to be
// declared in CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS on the server, and the two must remain on the same
// registrable domain for the session cookie to be sent at all.
